# Subspaces

## Overview
A subset $U$, of a vector space $V$, is considered a subspace of $V$, if $U$ is also a vector-space, if $0 \in U$, allowing for additive identity, and $U$ is also closed under addition and scalar multiplication.

Generally, we're focused on subspaces, as opposed to the entirety of the vector space.
