# Overoxidized (Under Construction).

overox is an individual with a penchant for programming (typically functional), and mathematical physics, and general intellectual expedition. Overoxidiz*ed* is his blog, wherein he will rant about the things that interest him, as if they are the most interesting things in the world- _because they are_.

This place will probably be stub/styling/formatting hell for *a while/ever*.
